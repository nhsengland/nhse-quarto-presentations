## Title Slides

Title slides are automatically generated using date, author, and title(s) metadata fields (if present).

You can also declare the `reference-doc` to use as the template for this presentation in the metadata field.

**Code**

```{markdown}

## Section Headers

These slides help to organise and breakup  your presentation. You create these with a H1 heading:

**Code**

```{markdown}
# Section Header Layout
```

---

# Section Header Layout

---

## Title and Content Layout

This is the most common slide layout - level 2 header (##) creates the slide title.

The content area can include:

- Bullet points like these
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- `Code snippets`
- Regular paragraphs of text

This layout works great for most presentation content and are used for all slides that do not match the criteria for another layout.

---

## Title and Content - Tables

Tables can be easy to add using the markdown table formatting:

**Code**

```{markdown}
| Feature | Option A | Option B |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Cost | $100 | $150 |
| Speed | Fast | Very Fast |
| Quality | Good | Excellent |
| Support | Email | Phone + Email |
```

| Feature | Option A | Option B |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Cost | $100 | $150 |
| Speed | Fast | Very Fast |
| Quality | Good | Excellent |
| Support | Email | Phone + Email |

## Title and Content - Images

Images can easily be inserted into your presentations with and without captions

### Code

With a caption:
```{markdown}
![Example image with a caption](example_image.jpg)
```
Without a caption:
```{markdown}
![](example_image.jpg)
```

---

## Title and Content - Images (Captioned)

![Example image with a caption](example_image.jpg)

---

## Title and Content - Images (Un-captioned)

![](example_image.jpg)

---

## Title and Content - Numbered Lists

### Code
```{markdown}
1. first
2. second
3. third
```

---

## Title and Content - Numbered Lists

1. This thing should come first
2. Then this!
3. Finally this...
4. ... or maybe this!

---

## Title and Content - Unordered Lists

### Code
```{markdown}
- first
- second
- third
```

---

## Title and Content - Unordered Lists

- These can help break up your points
- Make them easy to digest
- And keep your audience focused!

---

## Two Content Layout

This layout is used for two-column slides and can be created using the `.column` div class:

**Code**

```{markdown}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Column 1 Content
:::
::: {.column}
Column 2 Content
:::
:::: <!-- end columns -->
```

---

## Two Content Layout

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
### Left Content

- First point
- Second point
- Third point

You can put any content here including text, lists, or even simple tables.
:::

::: {.column}
### Right Content

- Different information
- Contrasting points
- Additional details

The two-column layout is useful for comparisons or complementary information.
:::

::::

---

## Comparison Layout

This layout is used instead of "Two-Content" layouts but for any two-column slides in which *both* columns contain text followed by non-text (e.g. an image or a table)

---

## Comparison Layout- Code

```{markdown}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Content A
![](example_image.jpg)
:::
::: {.column}
### Content B
| Feature  | Content B |
|----------|-----------|
| Hello    | World     |
:::
::::
```

---

## Comparison Layout

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
### Content A

![](example_image.jpg)

:::

::: {.column}
### Content B

| Feature  | Content B |
|----------|-----------|
| Price    | $200      |
| Warranty | 3 years   |
| Support  | 24/7      |

:::

---

## Content with Caption

This layout is used for any non-two-column slides which contain text followed by non-text (e.g an image or a table)

### Code
```{markdown}
Hmm looks like a shady character is coding here!

![](example_image.jpg)
```

---

## Content with Caption

Hmm looks like a shady character is coding here!

![](example_image.jpg)

---

## Blank Layout

You can create a blank slide by having minimal content.

Sometimes you just need space for discussion or to insert content manually in PowerPoint later.

### Code
```{markdown}
---

&nbsp; <!--This is a non-breaking space and ensure that a blank slide is created-->

---
```

---

## Simple Python Chart

### Code
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simple data
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr']
sales = [20, 25, 30, 28]

# Create chart
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.bar(months, sales, color='steelblue')
plt.title('Monthly Sales')
plt.ylabel('Sales (K)')
plt.show()
```

---

## Chart Output

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simple data
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr']
sales = [20, 25, 30, 28]

# Create chart
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.bar(months, sales, color='steelblue')
plt.title('Monthly Sales')
plt.ylabel('Sales (K)')
plt.show()
```

## Final Slides

We have to workaround Quarto's and Pandoc's limitations to create a nice final slide.

We do this by setting an empty slide to have a custom background image, which is the NHSE Final Slide.

### Code
```{markdown}
## {background-image="nhs_final_slide.png"}
```

---

## Summary - What We've Covered

In this presentation, we demonstrated how to:

- Use metadata and templates to control slide appearance
- Create title slides, section headers, and blank slides
- Format content with bullet points, numbered lists, and tables
- Build two-column and comparison layouts for side-by-side content
- Add images and captions to enhance your slides
- Embed and display Python code and charts directly in your presentation

These examples highlight the flexibility of Quarto for building professional PowerPoint presentations.
